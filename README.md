## Downloading images from Google
[hardikvasa](https://github.com/hardikvasa) has an amazing [git repository](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download) that allows you to download images from Google. Handy to scrap pictures for your neural network.

## Issues
If you get this error that looks something like this: `Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: AVX2 FMA keras` you need to do this to get rid of the warning `os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2'`.<br/>
